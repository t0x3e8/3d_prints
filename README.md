# 3D Prints and STEP Files Repository

Welcome to my collection of 3D printable models designed in FreeCAD! This repository contains .FCStd files (FreeCAD format) and .STEP files (standard CAD file format) for various 3D printed objects. Feel free to download, modify, or reference these files in your own projects.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to share my personal 3D print designs and make them accessible for anyone interested in printing or further modifying these models. By including both FreeCAD and STEP formats, I aim to provide flexibility for customization and ensure compatibility with a wide range of CAD software.

## Contents
- **.FCStd Files**: Original design files created in FreeCAD, which include full modeling history and can be easily edited.
- **.STEP Files**: Standard exchange format, suitable for importing into other CAD software, allowing for easy adjustments and printing without needing FreeCAD.

## How to Use
1. Browse through the files and select the model you're interested in.
2. Download either the `.FCStd` or `.STEP` file.
3. Use a 3D printing slicer of your choice (such as BambuStudio, Cura, PrusaSlicer, etc.) to prepare the file for printing, or open the file in your preferred CAD software for further modifications.

## License
All files in this repository are shared under the [MIT License](LICENSE), meaning you're free to use, modify, and distribute these designs as you see fit. Please provide appropriate credit if you use these files in your projects.

## Contributions
If you'd like to contribute by improving the models or sharing your own versions, feel free to open a pull request or raise an issue. Any feedback or suggestions are also welcome!

## Disclaimer
These files are provided as-is. I have tested many of these designs, but please ensure compatibility with your specific 3D printer and materials.
